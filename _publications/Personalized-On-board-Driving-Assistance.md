Driver reaction is of vital importance in risk scenarios. Drivers can take correct evasive maneuver at proper cushion time to avoid the potential traffic crashes, but this reaction process is highly experience-dependent and requires various levels of driving skills. To improve driving safety and avoid the traffic accidents, it is necessary to provide all road drivers with on-board driving assistance. This study explores the plausibility of case-based reasoning (CBR) as the inference paradigm underlying the choice of personalized crash evasive maneuvers and the cushion time, by leveraging the wealthy of human driving experience from the steady stream of traffic cases, which have been rarely explored in previous studies. To this end, in this paper, we propose an open evolving framework for generating personalized on-board driving assistance. In particular, we present the FFMTE model with high performance to model the traffic events and build the case database; A tailored CBR-based method is then proposed to retrieve, reuse and revise the existing cases to generate the assistance. We take the 100-Car Naturalistic Driving Study dataset as an example to build and test our framework; the experiments show reasonable results, providing the drivers with valuable evasive information to avoid the potential crashes in different scenarios.
