With the widespread use of the IoT, it is expected that advanced services for a smart and sustainable society will be created by interconnecting a wide variety of sensing data to generate and utilize actionable data that is useful for understanding complex situations in the real world and supporting actions appropriate to the situation. I am conducting the research and development of machine learning and data mining technologies for cross-data analysis that appropriately collects sensing data of various types and fields, and discovers, learns, and predicts their cross-sectional associations. Based on these technologies, I am building a platform necessary for the development of smart services that support safe and comfortable transportation and healthy lifestyles taking into account various social issues, and improve the human wellness.
