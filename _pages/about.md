I am a researcher at Big Data Integration Research Center, Universal Communication Research Institute, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology [(NICT)](https://bdirc.nict.go.jp/en/), Tokyo, Japan.

I received a Ph.D. in Informatics from National Institute of Informatics [(NII)](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/), The Graduate University for Advanced Studies (SOKENDAI) and a second Ph.D. in Educational Technology from Central China Normal University [(CCNU)](http://foaie.ccnu.edu.cn/Home/index.htm). Before joining NICT, I was an JSPS research fellow at National Institute of Informatics and a postdoctoral fellow at Central China Normal University Wollongong Joint Institute [(CCNU-UOW)](http://uowji.ccnu.edu.cn/en/Home.htm).

My main work mostly focuses on researching and developing data-driven models for intelligent human-computer interaction and intelligent tutoring systems. I have done researches span topics in Intelligent Tutoring System and AI Enhanced Learning, including Automated Question Solver (especially in plane geometry), Question Understanding, Image Understanding, Language & Vision, Educational robots, Educational Human-computer Interaction, etc. I served as a JSPS project Principal Investigator for data-driven personalization of student online learning support [(see project page)](https://kaken.nii.ac.jp/grant/KAKENHI-PROJECT-20J15339/). My current research interests involve developing data mining and deep learning algorithms to discover insights of learners and learning contents in support of personalized cyber-physical learning, using techniques incorporating IoT multi-modal learning analytics, deep learning, virtual reality as well as the integrated research with educational robots.
